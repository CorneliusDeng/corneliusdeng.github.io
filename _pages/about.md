<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Qi Deng, final year Master student of computer technology at School of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). My supervisor is [Prof. Lijun Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lijun-Wu-4).  I have completed all of my academic courses and successfully submitted my dissertation proposal, passing the mid-term review. I am currently in the process of writing my Master‚Äôs thesis, titled ‚ÄúResearch and Implementation of Adaptive Traffic Signal Control Algorithm Based on Reinforcement Learning.‚Äù I am on track to defend my thesis in May 2025 and obtain my Master's degree in June 2025. I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Software Engineering at [Chengdu University of Information Technology (CUIT)](https://english.cuit.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on reinforcement learning, multimodal machine learning, game theory, and LLM-based agents, which are the tangible expressions of my passion for realizing artificial general intelligence. My research vision is to integrate reinforcement learning, multimodal machine learning, and game theory, aiming to develop artificial intelligence agents that perceive their environment, learn from multimodal data, improve from human feedback or preferences, coordinate actions for common goals, and adapt dynamically.

I am currently seeking opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. If you're interested in my background and research, please feel free to check my [Curriculum Vitae](../individual/CV.pdf) and [Research Statement](../individual/RS.pdf).
