<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Qi Deng, a PhD student in Computer Science at the School of Engineering and Computer Science, [Victoria University of Wellington (VUW)](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/). My supervisors are [A/Prof. Aaron Chen](https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/Aaron.Chen) and [A/Prof. Yi Mei](https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/Yi.Mei). My research focuses on reinforcement learning, multimodal machine learning, game theory, and LLM-based agents, which are the tangible expressions of my passion for realizing artificial general intelligence. My research vision is to integrate reinforcement learning, multimodal machine learning, and game theory, aiming to develop artificial intelligence agents that perceive their environment, learn from multimodal data, improve from human feedback or preferences, coordinate actions for common goals, and adapt dynamically.

Previously, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Technology at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at [Chengdu University of Information Technology (CUIT)](https://english.cuit.edu.cn/).
